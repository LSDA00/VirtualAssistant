# VirtualAssistant
This is an ongoing project in which I use python to try to design my own personal assistant, similar to Siri or Alexa. Right now it uses a neural network machine learning algorithm to pull a users 'intent' from their given directive. This as well as word lemmatization allow for enhanced decision making based on pattern recognition. I will be adding a better speech recognition engine and trying to improve speed, it's a little clunky atm. 
A work in progress :)
